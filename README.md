1. Create your own nbox appliance: ```vagrant up```

2. SSH into the appliance with ```vagrant ssh```

3. Check for (some) of the nbox vulnerabilities with ```cd /vagrant && ./checker.sh```

4. Did you find more? Pull Request welcome!

UPDATE: Issues have been (silently) fixed again. So no more paintrain... For now!
